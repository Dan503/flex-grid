    ### Version 3.0.0

      - Gutter Grid will now install whatever version of mq-scss is available (defaulting to the latest version)
      - **Breaking change:** You now need to set the `$grid-legacy-support` setting to `true` if you wish to support browsers that do not support flexbox natively. (Change made to drastically reduce the amount of bloat found in the output css).

    ### Version 2.0.0

    #### What's new?

      - Gutter Grid now comes in mixin flavour!
      - Gutters can now have different vertical vs horizontal gutter widths
      - Column media queries can now take [mq-scss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mq-scss) syntax for defining completely custom breakpoints
      - Improved legacy browser support
      - Reduced specificity on class based selectors for easier overriding of styles

    #### Breaking changes

    ##### Reduced specificity in class names

    If upgrading, none of the class names have changed, however the reduced specificity will mean that you may need to update your styles to not conflict with the new grid system.

    ##### New format for assigning column break points

    The new format to the column break points is a bit different to the original. before it was a list of screen-sizes then column widths with a space in between each one.

    Version 1.x

    `````
    (
      600px 100%
    )
    `````

    Column width is now stated first, and screen width is stated second. By default, the screen width will be calculated as a `max-width` media query. However, you can now provide [mq-scss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mq-scss) syntax as an alternative to stating a screen width pixel value. This means that you can define the column break points using just about any media query you like. Taking a mobile first `min-width` approach will break legacy browser support though unless you have [UnMQ](https://github.com/jonathantneal/postcss-unmq) integrated into your build process.

    Version 2.x

    `````
    (
      100% : 600px, //state a max-width pixel value
      //or
      100% : (max, 600px), //provide a custom mq-scss media query
    )
    `````

    ##### New format for assigning gutter break-points

    The new way of assigning breakpoints to gutters isn't much different to the original method. The only incompatible difference being that now you need to write `mq` with a space after it before the list of values (the space is vital).

    Version 1.x

    `````scss
    $grid-cell-gutters: (
        'mediaQueryGutter' : (
            50px,
            30px (max, 800px),
            10px (max, 700px)
        )
    );
    `````

    Version 2.x

    `````scss
    $grid-cell-gutters: (
        'mediaQueryGutter' : mq (
            50px,
            30px (max, 800px),
            10px (max, 700px)
        )
    );
    `````
