    Please select weather you would prefer to use the class based system or the mixin based system (This sets which version is shown by default in the documentation examples)

        The class based system is designed so that you can control the grid layout primarily through the html markup

        Any class that doesn't feature `grid` at the start of it's name is not part of the grid system. The minimum 100px height on grid cells is not part of the grid system either.

        The grid system classes follow a pattern based on the BEM naming convention with the exception that it uses camelCase when necessary to retain clear grouping:

        - **`grid`** initializes the grid functionality and acts as the grid module declaration

        - **`grid__elementName`** double underscores in a class name represent an element of the grid. Each element of a grid always goes in the same position relative to it's relevant `grid` class.

        - **`grid--settingName`** grid settings are represented with double dashes before the setting name. Grid settings alter the functionality of how the whole grid behaves.

        - **`grid--settingName-specifierName`** If a setting has a specifier, the setting name defines what setting is being set. The specifier sets the value of the setting and is represented by a single dash before the specifier name.

        - **`grid__elementName--settingName`** a setting name after a grid element name is a setting that applies only to that grid element.

        - **`grid__elementName--settingName-specifierName`** cell based settings can have specifiers as well.

        If the naming convention looks daunting, don't worry. The classes are actually quite simple when you start looking through the examples.

        The mixin based system is designed so that you can control the grid layout primarily through SCSS stylesheets.

        While it does require a specific HTML structure to work, it does not require any specific HTML classes to be added to elements. This makes the mixin version ideal for CMS's like Drupal that do not give very much control over the markup that is output.

        The classes used in the examples feature names like `mixin__cell` and `mixin__inner` to make the examples clearer. These classes are not part of the actual system though and do not need to be used in your project.


  +demo({
    classes: {
html:`
.grid
  .grid__cell.-color-1
  .grid__cell.-color-2`,
},
    mixin: {
html:`
.mixin-1
  .mixin__cell.-color-1
  .mixin__cell.-color-2`,
scss: `
.mixin-1 {
  @include grid;
}
`
    }
})

      The bare bones markup of what you need for Gutter Grid to work (excluding color classes)

    That example is a bit misleading though. Having 2 grid cells doesn't necessarily mean they will always be 50% width each

  +demo({
    classes: {
html:`
.grid
  .grid__cell.-color-1.add-padding
    :marked
      lots and lots and lots of text in this cell.

      The previous example, but one cell has a lot of text while the other barely has any
