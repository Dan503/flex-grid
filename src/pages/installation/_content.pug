		```````
		npm install gutter-grid --save
		```````

		A dependency that gutter-grid has is [mq-scss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mq-scss). This is used for the media queries.

		After npm installing gutter-grid, add this to the top of your main Sass file:

		`````scss
		@import '../node_modules/mq-scss/mq';
		@import '../node_modules/gutter-grid/grid-classes';
		`````

		Things to note:

		- mq-scss will automatically install when installing gutter-grid
		- I've purposly not put the mq-scss include in the grid Sass file so that users will more likely see that mq-scss is available for them to use
		- Make sure that the import paths are actually correct. They will differ depending on your folder structure.

		At this point, you are able to use the grid system and it will work well in any browsers that have **full standards complient flexbox support**. There are many old browsers that don't feature that level of support though. If your site needs to support those older browsers, there are a few more steps you need to take.

		> Read **[how to support legacy browsers](#how-to-support-legacy-browsers)** to get a run down on how to achieve maximum browser compatibility.
